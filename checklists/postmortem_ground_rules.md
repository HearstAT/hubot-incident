Post Mortem Ground Rules
========================

Understand that incidents occur, it is our job to fix them in the least amount of time possible and reduce the recurrence approaching zero.

The focus of this meeting is to:

* Identify the true root cause of the issue
* Discuss Action Items to alleviate a future issue with the same or similar root cause

In this meeting:

* Review the timeline of actual events, focus on facts
* Do not blame individuals, instead focus on how the system or process broke down
* Raise hands when the words "should" or "could" are used, instead focus on what to do next time
* Only take action items that are assigned and will be tracked like other work
* Categorize this root cause in relation to other issues
